ðŸŒŸ Hi there! Iâ€™m passionate about data engineering, and my journey revolves around Spark, Databricks, Azure, data modeling, and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load). Let me break it down:

- âš¡ Spark: I thrive on the power of Apache Spark! Whether itâ€™s processing massive datasets, running complex analytics, or building machine learning pipelines, Spark is my go-to tool.
- âš¡ Databricks: Iâ€™m a Databricks enthusiast! This cloud-based platform provides an ideal environment for collaborative data science and engineering. I love exploring its features, notebooks, and clusters.
- âš¡ Azure: Azure is my playground! As a Microsoft Azure aficionado, I leverage its services for scalable data solutions. From storage to compute, Azure provides the foundation for my data adventures.
- âš¡ Data Modeling: Iâ€™m all about structuring data elegantly. Whether itâ€™s designing star schemas, snowflakes, or creating efficient data models, I find joy in shaping data for optimal insights.
- âš¡ ETL: Extract, Transform, Loadâ€”my bread and butter! I orchestrate ETL pipelines, wrangle messy data, and ensure smooth data flows. Transforming raw data into valuable insights? Thatâ€™s my jam!

- ðŸ“« Feel free to connectâ€”Iâ€™m always up for discussing data challenges, sharing insights, and collaborating on exciting projects! ðŸš€
